# Snowflake-Cognitive-Services
Azure Cognitive Services are a great resource for getting insights from pre-built, complex models in short order. If you're not familiar with Cognitive Services they are, effectively, pre-trained models that can be deployed in Azure and you can pass data to the model via an API call to retrieve insights or inference.

# Business Case
Free text physicianâ€™s notes are rich with details on cases and patients, however it takes time to extract the information from the notes, appropriately label the extracted text and present them for insights.

Text Analytics for Health is a cognitive service from Microsoft Azure that extracts and labels relevant medical information from unstructured texts such as doctor's notes, discharge summaries, clinical documents, and electronic health records.

Getting started with text analytics for health is as simple as creating a language resource in Azure and making a REST API call to pass the unstructured data to the resource and retrieve insights.
